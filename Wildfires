# This code was gathered from a Kaggle dataset. 

# I started by looking into wildfires that were larger than 50,000 acres in each state/county. I also included the name of the fire and the year it occurred. 
SELECT
STATE, COUNTY, FIRE_YEAR, FIRE_NAME, FIRE_SIZE
FROM Fires
WHERE FIRE_SIZE > 50000
AND COUNTY IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY STATE, FIRE_SIZE;

# I then went deeper and found the 5 largest  wildfires by county within California.

STATE, COUNTY, FIRE_YEAR, FIRE_NAME, FIRE_SIZE
FROM Fires
WHERE FIRE_SIZE > 50000
AND COUNTY IS NOT NULL

# I then found the amount of unique wildires that occurred in California in the year 2006.
