# First I created a table using data that I gathered from Kaggle. Attached is the link for this data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/us-police-shootings-from-20152022
CREATE TABLE Shootings (
id INT,
name VARCHAR (255),
date DATE,
manner_of_death VARCHAR (255),
armed VARCHAR (255),
age INT,
gender VARCHAR (1),
race VARCHAR (1),
city VARCHAR (255),
state VARCHAR (2),
signs_of_mental_illness VARCHAR (255),
threat_level VARCHAR (255),
flee VARCHAR (255),
body_camera VARCHAR (255),
longitude DECIMAL(6,3),
latitude DECIMAL (6,3),
is_geocoding_exact VARCHAR (255)
);

# From there, I decided to take a closer look at the data by selecting all of the data within the first 10 columns. 
SELECT *
FROM Shootings
LIMIT 10;

# Then I began to look into cases grouped by race, gender, and state

  # 1. Group by Race
  SELECT 
  race, COUNT(id) 
   From Shootings
  Group by race

  # 2. Group by Gender
  SELECT 
  gender, COUNT(id)
  FROM Shootings
  GROUP BY gender

  # 3. Group by State
  SELECT
  state, COUNT(id) AS deaths
  FROM Shootings
  GROUP BY state
  ORDER BY deaths DESC;
  
# I also wanted to find top 5 cities whose names start with the letter "A" and have the highest amount of deaths.
SELECT 
DISTINCT(city), COUNT(id) AS deaths
FROM Shootings
WHERE city LIKE 'A%'
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY deaths DESC
LIMIT 5;

# With the previous query, we can see that California has the highest deaths out of all states. I decided to find what cities had the highest deaths. 
SELECT
city, COUNT(id) AS deaths
FROM Shootings
WHERE state = 'CA'
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY deaths DESC;

# Then I found the most frequent form of death in California.
SELECT
manner_of_death, COUNT(id) AS deaths
FROM Shootings
WHERE state = 'CA';

# I then looked into how many of these vitims suffered from mental illness.
SELECT
manner_of_death, COUNT(id) AS deaths
FROM Shootings
WHERE signs_of_mental_illness = 'TRUE'

# Then I found the top 3 weapons (if applicable) the victims had on them. I excluded 'unarmed' as this was the 3rd top reason for death.
SELECT
armed, COUNT(id) AS deaths
FROM Shootings
WHERE armed is not 'unarmed'
GROUP BY armed
ORDER BY deaths DESC
LIMIT 3;

# I also found the death breakdown by race while the victim was unarmed. 
SELECT
